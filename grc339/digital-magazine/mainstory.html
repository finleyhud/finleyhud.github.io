				<h2>Spotlight: Ovidiu Selaru's Contrast</h2>
				<p>In his latest black-and-white series, Contrast, Romanian-born, London-based photographer Ovidiu Selaru invites viewers into a world where light and shadow engage in a silent, powerful dialogue. Captured with Leica SL2 cameras and 35mm and 50mm lenses, these images transcend mere documentation, offering a profound exploration of urban solitude and architectural rhythm. Selaru's work is characterized by a deep understanding of geometry and an instinctive grasp of human behavior. His background in machinery and the exact sciences informs his photographic approach, allowing him to capture specific emotions through angles, light, and composition. In Contrast, this manifests as a series of images where the interplay of light and shadow creates a dynamic tension, drawing the viewer into the scene.
				</p>
				<p>Selaru is a self-taught photographer with an uncanny ability to transform silence into subject. Contrast is both a technical masterclass and a meditation: each frame explores the tension between exposure and concealment, isolation and presence. The human figures that occasionally appear are not protagonists but notes in a broader architectural symphony—markers of scale, fragility, and reflection.

					Where some black and white photography leans heavily on nostalgia, Selaru’s work is undeniably modern. Minimalist but never sterile, his compositions are meticulously clean yet emotionally layered. The series doesn't lecture. It observes. And in doing so, it offers a profound sense of space—both the physical space within each image and the psychological space it gives the viewer to feel.

				<p>Cities speak in quiet rhythms. Beneath the hum of traffic and the drone of modern life, there exists a subtler language—one of cast shadows, momentary gestures, and unnoticed alignments. It’s in this language that Selaru finds his fluency. His work reveals how built environments choreograph human behavior: how people drift toward light, hesitate at thresholds, or pause unconsciously in framed spaces. These are not grand narratives but quiet incidents of presence—fleeting alignments of time and space that would vanish without the camera’s intervention. In many ways, Contrast operates less like a document and more like a meditation, inviting viewers to slow down and recognize the theater unfolding around them. Each image becomes a study in dualities: stillness and motion, vastness and intimacy, form and feeling. There’s no overt message—just an invitation to witness, to inhabit a moment more fully, and to consider the quiet power of looking.</p>
				<p>Selaru's ability to find beauty in the mundane is evident throughout Contrast. His photographs transform ordinary urban scenes into compelling visual narratives, each image telling a story through its composition and use of light. This approach aligns with his belief that photography is not just about capturing images but about conveying emotions and messages to the viewer.

				<p>For those interested in exploring the nuances of black-and-white photography further, resources like Creative Black & White (2nd Edition) by Harold Davis offer valuable insights into the techniques and philosophies behind this art form. Selaru's Contrast series serves as a testament to the power of photography to reveal the unseen, to frame the invisible, and to find meaning in the interplay of light and shadow. Through his lens, the everyday becomes extraordinary, inviting viewers to see the world anew.
